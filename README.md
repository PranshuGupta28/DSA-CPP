# 📘 DSA in C++

Welcome to my personal repository where I regularly upload solutions and implementations of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) using C++. Whether you're brushing up on the basics or diving into advanced patterns, you'll find clean, understandable code to guide you through.

## 📂 Structure

This repo is organized by topic:
- `Sorting/` – Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Bubble Sort and more
- `Recursion/` – Classic recursive problems and backtracking
- `LinkedList/`, `Stacks/`, `Queues/`, etc. – Fundamental data structures
- `Trees/`, `Graphs/` – Traversals, search algorithms, and graph techniques
- `DP/` – Dynamic programming problems and patterns
- `Misc/` – Anything that doesn’t quite fit the mold

> I keep code modular, readable, and well-commented for learning and revision.

## 💡 Why this Repo?

- Practice and revise DSA problems in C++
- Improve coding skills for competitive programming and interviews
- Serve as a learning resource for others in the community

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- Language: C++
- IDE: [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) / any C++ compiler
- OS: Windows / Linux
